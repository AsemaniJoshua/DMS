Lets make these changes:

When adding users at #file:AddUser.jsx  this is the error so fix it. error: Missing required fields: role, username, email, password.

For the settings components #file:Settings.jsx , After editing an  info and the user clicks on the save button, give the buttn a saving state so that the user will tha that a process is ongoing.
Also at the settings component, at the disability type tab, you have to change the layout because this is how the logic works: you have to load all disability caegories so that the user the user can select the disability category in which he/she wants to add a disability type for it after that to hit the corresponding endpoint from #file:API_DOCUMENTATION.md to add a disability type for that category.
Also do justice for the editing and the deleting of disability types.

After these, update the register pwd for admin and officer #file:RegisterPWD.jsx and #file:RegisterPWD.jsx respectively so that based on the disability category that was chosen, the corresponding disability types will show and when sending the payloads, in terms of the disability categories,  disability type, community, and assistance type, you will send their corresponding ids instead of the names that was select or chosen.

For the request assistance for admin and officer at the #file:AdminDashboardLayout.jsx and #file:OfficerDashboardLayout.jsx create a component for them and update the routing in #file:main.jsx . This is how the layout for the request assistance should be: At this component, the user can request new assistance when they click on a request assistance button which will take them to #file:LogAssistance.jsx or #file:LogAssistance.jsx respectively base on the dashboard. In the same component, all users that has request for assitance will be load using the appropriate endpoint in #file:API_DOCUMENTATION.md and the information will be arranged in a tabular form. Use the sample response in #file:API_DOCUMENTATION.md when you fetch for all user that has requested for assisstance to create the table and know the columns to show. For the request assitance component, there has to be an action column in the table you will create where there will be only view icon which when clicked, it will take the user to view all information for that particaular recoed in a component that you will create for the viewing of requested assitance and update the routing in #file:main.jsx .

In Requesting for assitance in #file:LogAssistance.jsx and #file:LogAssistance.jsx , Make some modifications in the forms: The assistance types has to be loaded from the backend using the respective endpoint, there will be no date of approval, for the Beneficiary Details section, the has to be only one input which will be a select input which is the beneficiary name and for this input, all names from the pwd record will be loaded there so the the user can tselect the particular beneficiary and also the user can start typing in the select to filter the users. When a user is selected, other fields will appera prefilled with their information from the pwd data for that particular user. The fields includes gender, contact, date of birth, age, assistance needed, disability category and disability type. Also amount needed wll be send as amount_value_cost when sending information to the backend using the respective endpoint as you will see in #file:API_DOCUMENTATION.md when requesting fro new assistance. THere will be no supporting doument field. Also "Assessment was conducted before support" section will be removed. And Assessment Notes will be sent to the backend as description.
